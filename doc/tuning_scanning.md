# Neumo-blindscan

## Tuning, spectrum acquisition and blindscan

### Tuning and streaming multiple streams of a multistream mux

The following works only on stid135.

First tune to a mux, using adapter 8 and the LNB the cable connected to RF input 1. The LNB is connected to a switch
on uncommitted port 3. The mux we tune is 12606V on 5.0W. It uses physical layer srambling with code ROOT+16416.
We ask the frontend to output bbframes instead of a stransport stream:

`neumo-tune -ctune -A blind -a 8 -r 1 -U3 -f 12606000 -pV --pls-code=ROOT+16416  --stream-id=4 -b`

Now extract the two streams by connecting to frontend 0 on demux 8. We specify 0x2000 as the pid,
which means the whole transport stream. the two streams have ISI 3 and 5:
`neumo-dmx -a 8 -d 0 --pid 0x2000 -b   --bbframes-isi=4 > /tmp/stream4.ts &`

`neumo-dmx -a 8 -d 0 --pid 0x2000 -b   --bbframes-isi=5 > /tmp/stream5.ts &`

After a while stop the three commands (neumo-tune and neumo-dmx).
Stream 4 is a regular transport stream as can be seen by inspecting it with
`tsanalyze /tmp/stream4.ts'.

Stream 5 is a transport stream containineg one T2mi stream with pid 0x1000. Extract it as follows:

`tsp -P t2mi --pid=0x1000  < /tmp/stream5.ts > /tmp/stream5b.ts`
Then it can be analyzed as follows:
`tsanalyze /tmp/stream5b.ts'.

### Tuning and streaming a T2MI stream

First tune to a mux 12606V on adapter 8, and optionally specify the default stream_id 4
`neumo-tune -ctune -A blind -a 8 -r 1 -U3 -f 12606000 -pV --pls-code=ROOT+16416  --stream-id=4 -b`

Then ask the demux to select stream 5 embedded in pid 270 from adapter 8. Also ask it to then
internally demux the T2MI stream embedded in pid 4096 to a transport stream. Then ask that this transport
stream is extracted full by specifying the fake pid 0x2000 that means ``full transport stream''

`neumo-dmx -a 8 -d 0 --stid-isi=5 --stid-pid=270 --t2mi-pid=4096 --t2mi-plp=0 --pid 0x2000  > /tmp/stream5.ts`

### Tuning and streaming a GSE or GCS stream

The following works only on stid135.

First tune to the mux containing the GSE or GCS stream. For example, tune to the NRK dab  mux on 5.0W:
`neumo-tune -ctune -A blind -a 8 -r 0 -dU -U2 -s 171 -f 10717000 -pV  -S 5400`

The the following command will stream save the bbframes of this GSE stream to an output file:
`neumo-dmx  -a 8  --fe-stream --pid=270 > /tmp/out.ts`
Note that the output file conists of bbframes encapsulated in a transport stream. Only pid=270
will work because that is the one selected by the stid135 chip.

A command like the following can be used to decode the dab stream:
`neumo-dmx  -a 8  --fe-stream --pid=270 | pts2bbf | bbfedi2eti -dst-ip 239.199.2.1 -dst-port 1234 | dablin_gtk`
This involves extracting the bbframes, then extracting eti data from the bbframes stream and sending the
results to dablin_gtk.


### Spectrum Acquisition

There are two methods of spectrum acquisition: `sweep` and `fft`. `sweep` sweeps across the frequency spectrum and measures
narrow band power, taking into account AGC settings. `fft` uses the builtin fft engine on the stid135 chip to scan
the spectrum in very high resolution (100kHz per default, but 50kHz sometimes detects more narrow band transponders).

The spectrum will be saved to `/tmp/spectrum_rf2_H.dat` and `/tmp/spectrum_rf2_V.dat`, or similarly named files.

#### Sweep method
`neumo-blindscan  -c spectrum -U8 -a0  --rf-in=2 --spectrum-method sweep --spectral-resolution 2000`
will perform a sweep scan with 2MHz resolution. On stid135 this is actually slower than fft scan.
It will get a full spectrum in less 30 seconds with a resolution of 2MHz on tbs5927.

#### FFT method
`neumo-blindscan  -c spectrum -U8 -a0  --rf-in=2 --spectrum-method fft --spectral-resolution 100` will scan a satellite
in less 30 seconds with a resolution of 100kHz on tbs6909x and tbs6903x. This is using the internal high speed fft engine.

Here are some example spectra for 5.0West; horizontal and vertical.

Here is a portion of a 100kHz spectrum captured on 5.0West, horizontal polarization created on tbs6909x
It shows several narrow band transponders

### Blindscan
The blind scan code scans all or some of the frequency spectrum
available on a DVB-S2 tuner. The scanned portion is the range
[start-freq, end-freq]. Unless `-p` is specified, both polarizations
will be scanned. There are two ways of scanning: `exhaustive` and `spectral-peaks`.

This blind scanner can also scan transponders which have "Physical Layer Scrambling" turned
on. When it discovers such a transponder it uses its built-in codes (for the multistreams on
5.0West). Additional mod_modes/mod_codes can be added using --pls-modes. For example `--pls-modes ROOT+12 GOLD+13`
adds two codes to try.

It is also possible to specify a range of ROOT+x codes to test. This option is very slow but
will take around 90 minutes at most. Currently  this is not working on stid135.

#### Exhaustive scan
The spectrum is scanned in steps of step-freq. The default
value is fine for scanning high symbolrate transponders.
To scan low symbol rate transponders, set max-symbol-rate to a low value
and star-freq close to where they might be.

#### Spectral peaks scan

`neumo-blindscan  -c blindscan -U8 -a0  --rf-in=2 -pV --spectral-resolution 100` will connect adapter 0
to RF input 2 and scan the full vertical band.

First the spectrum is analyzed to find candidate transponders and then a blindscan is performed
on those transponders. If the transponder locks, the output is saved.
Then the actual blindscan starts and results are printed on the terminal and saved
in `/tmp/blindscan_rf2_V.dat`. Here is a sample output:

```
SEARCH: 10700.000-11700.000 pol=V

	FE_GET_EVENT: stat=543, signal=1 carrier=1 viterbi=1 sync=1 timedout=0 locked=1

```

On stv091x, the code searches for falling or rising edges of transponders. This is less reliable
than the stid135 algorithm (see below). After a blindscan succeeds, the spectrum part for that transponder
is skipped to avoid double detections and to save time. The main search parameters are

* max-symbol-rate: determines how far to scan from an edge in the spectrum. Set higher for high symbol rates. High values
are usually recommended.


On stid135, the code searches for central frequencies of transponders after acquiring the complete spectrum.
The spectrum is of high resolution and the peak detector is more sophisticated. As a result most spectral peaks are
found, even very weak or very narrow band ones. The code scans all candidate peaks and skips the spectrum part
for any found transponder. The main search parameters are:

* search-range: determines how far to search from the center of frequency peaks. A typical vale is 10000
* spectral-resolution: determines how finely to scan the spectrum. Use 50 for very low symbolrates. Otherwise use 100.

The stid135 algorithm's peak finding is more reliable. On the other hand, the actual blindscan is slower for
and less reliable for low symbol rates compared to stv091x. Also scanning false peaks is especially slow and
this makes scanning slower than it could be.
With the current code, scanning a full satellite (H and V; 10700Ghz-12750Ghz) takes a few minutes.

The most influential parameters are `spectral-resolution` (100kHz is fine, 50kHz is sometimes better), and
`search-range` (default: 10Mhz, higher is sometimes better).  `spectral-resolution` determines the accuracy
of the spectrum. Candidate peaks may be lost if the value is too high. `search-range` determines how far from the
candidate peak the blindscan can search for a lock. To find high symbolrate transponders (30Ms/s and more), a
larger value will find more transponders if the peak-finder does not find the center of the transponder, but
rather a value closer to its edges.

Below is an older example for scanning 5.0W with default parameters.

![example 100kHz resolution fft scan 5.0W Horizontal](doc/images/tbs6909x_5.0wH_100kHz.png)

The green pluses indicate the found transponders. The orange ones are the candidate peaks. Several
narrow band transponders are found properly (11456H, 2400 kS/s and 11480H, 3124kS/s), but three transponders with very low symbolrate are missed (11458H, 542 kS/s and 11465H, 668kS). 11465H, 668kS can be found sometimes with a spectral
resolution setting o5 50kHz and can be tuned to reliably. The other one does not tune, even on stv091x on Linux,
even though it can be done on Windows. So the drivers need some more improvement.


#### Parallel blindscan

On tbs6909x, blindscan can use all tuners

`stid135-blindscan  -cblindscan -a 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -U8   --rf-in=2 -pV` will connect all adapters
to RF input 2 and scan the full vertical band



### Obtaining constellation samples

`neumo-tune -a 0 -U 8 -c iq -f 10719000 -pV  -n 8000` will connect to adapter 8, tune to 11138V  and obtain
8000 IQ samples. The samples will be saved in `/tmp/iq_a0_10719.000V.dat`
Currently this requires an active DVB signal. This will not work for inactive transponders or continuous stream transponders. The script plotiq.py can be used to view the samples. Ypu will need to install pandas, e.g.,

```
pip3 install pandas
```

### Blindscan tuning a single transponder

`neumo-tune -a 0  -Ablind --rf-in=2 -U 8 -c tune -f 10719000 -pV` will connect adapter 0 to
RF INPUT 2 on the card, send uncommitted switch command 8, tune to 10719V with the specified parameters  and then wait forever.

The output will look like this:

```
